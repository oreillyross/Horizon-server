This marked the first time that Lebanon has ever held elections based on a proportional representation law.\n\tPrime Minister Saad Hariri was designated on May 24, 2018 to form a new cabinet, which still awaited birth to date.\n\tAt the political level, the year 2018 witnessed a \"historic\" reconciliation between Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea and Marda Movement Leader, Sleiman Frangieh. \n\tAlso, an unprecedented social media political wrangling and controversy has been witnessed among Lebanon’s political figures who resorted to twitter to echo their stances and voices on different issues.\n\tAt the economic level, this year witnessed the convening of Rome II Conference in support of the Lebanese army and apparatuses, as well as CEDRE Conference; however, the implementation of both conferences remains pending.\n\tIn 2018, a huge dispute broke out between the state and power generator owners after the state’s installation of meters, and the confiscation of generators whose owners failed to comply with the decision of Caretake Minister of Economy, Raed Khoury.\n\tThe reeling economic situation did not spare Lebanon’s housing loans, which remain suspended to date.\n\tOn another level, the voluntary return of Syrian refugees in Lebanon to Syria took place under the supervision of the Lebanese General Security.\n\tThis year, ill-fated road accidents up and down Lebanon have left approximately 400 dead and 7,000 wounded.\n\tAt the international level, the most prominent had been the yellow jackets’ massive protests in Paris against a rise in gasoline prices. Also, a historic handshake was witnessed between the leaders of the two Koreas.\n\tFinally, 2018 witnessed the shocking arrest of “Nissan” board chairman, Carlos Ghosn (of Lebanese origin), in Japan.\n\tJANUARY 2018\n\t1/1\n\t- New Year's Eve Riots in France result in burning of over thousand cars\n\t- VAT 11% comes into effect\n\t- People killed in unrest in Iran\n\t \n\t2/1\n\t- Saudi Ambassador to Lebanon Walid Al-Yaacoub presents credentials to Foreign Minister, Gebran Bassil\n\t- 14 worshipers shot dead on way back from church in Nigeria\n\t \n\t3/1\n\t - 14 killed in a suicide attack on mosque in Nigeria\n\t- Commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard announces end of unrest\n\t \n\t4/1\n\t- 18 killed, 254 wounded in train wreck in South Africa\n\t \n\t5/1\n\t- Dead and wounded persons in Zidaniyah\n\t \n\t6/1\n\t- Arab Ministerial Meeting for Jerusalem and Palestine.\n\tSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubair: “We have come out with key measures to address Trump decision on Al-Quds.”\n\t \n\t7/1\n\t- Minister of Finance, Ali Hassan Khalil, adheres to constitutional rights, regularity of political action “over 1994 officers dossier.”\n\t \n\t8/1\n\t- President of the Republic stresses judiciary’s power to give final word in 1994 officers’ decree case, while Speaker maintains House of Representatives’ right to have final say on case.\n\t- Pope calls on Europeans to accept integration of immigrants regardless of their religious affiliations\n\t \n\t9/1\n\t- Minister of Public Works and Transportation, Youssef Fenianos, signs decree appointing 125 persons who passed Civil Service Board’s air observer tests\n\t \n\t10/1\n\t- Israeli device found in outlying area of Zawtar al-Sharkiya\n\t- Syrian sets himself on fire in Tripoli\n\t \n\t11/1\n\t- New scientific discovery at LAU of Italian genetic fingerprints of Phoenicians in Sardinia\n\t- Commander of US Central Command’s naval forces visits Lebanon to discuss Rome conference of donors\n\t- Communication channels reopened between Future Movement, Lebanese Forces.\n\t \n\t12/1\n\t- President of the Republic signs paternity leave bill\n\t \n\t13/1\n\t- 6 Injured in car slide on Ansar highway\n\t \n\t14/1\n\t- Army: Car bomb explodes in Sidon targeting Mohammad Hamdan (Hamas activist)\n\t \n\t15/1\n\t- More than 30 killed in twin suicide attack in central Baghdad\n\t- Speaker Nabih Berri leaves to Tehran to participate in Islamic Parliaments Conference: My proposal on officers' decree beneficial to Lebanon\n\t- Minister of Information, Melhem Riachy, meets Minister of Foreign Affairs, FPM leader Gebran Bassil, and MP Ibrahim Kanaan, “to follow up on reconciliation away from differences.”\n\t- Canadian Foreign Ministry warns citizens against traveling to Lebanon\n\t \n\t16/1\n\t- Beirut selected as headquarters for Chinese Council for Trade Promotion\n\t \n\t17/1\n\t- Speaker Nabih Berri meets Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran\n\t- US decides to freeze funds allocated to UNRWA\n\t \n\t18/1\n\t- MP Ibrahim Kanaan from Maarab: Reconciliation stable, political and electoral files under discussion.
